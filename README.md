# Linear-Search

Linear Search is the most basic method of searching an element from a list. It is also known as sequential search, as it sequentially checks each element of the list until the key element is found or the entire list has been traversed. It uses conditional statements and relational operators to find whether the given element is present in the list or not. It is easy to learn and implement.

How Linear Search Works?

Step 1: First, read the search element (Target element) in the array.

Step 2: Set an integer i = 0 and repeat steps 3 to 4 till i reaches the end of the array.

Step 3: Match the key with arr[i].

Step 4: If the key matches, return the index. Otherwise, increment i by 1.

When to use Linear Search?

When we are dealing with a small dataset.

When you need to find an exact value.

When you are searching a dataset stored in contiguous memory.

When you want to implement a simple algorithm.
